# Testing project with browser automation tool Microsoft Playwright + Java

Microsoft has a new open source web automation tool, [Playwright]. It recently released support for Java. Here are
example tests that demonstrate how to use Playwright, including creating Page Objects.

Playwright is a browser automation tool and not necessarily limited to a testing framework and does not provide any
assertion methods. Therefore, to this project is added an assertion library - TestNG.
